# nPrkl
Cross platform terminal user interface library, similar to ncurses and termbox.

Are you tired of ncurses color limitations? Are you sick of PDCurses? Do you find Termbox good but don't like that its not cross platform? Do you just want to include one header and be done with it?

If you say yes, nPrkl might be the choice of a library for you.

Features planned:

* single header file
* real cross platform support
* Support for extended colors if avaivable
* Downscaling the colors on when needed
* Input support


** The project is highly work in progress and I do not recommend to use it for now. **
